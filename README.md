> [!CAUTION]
> This is not purely written in Nix-Language. You should check ZaneyOS. Link below

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The install scripts assumes a clean installation of NixOS or the understanding that it will replace any existing configuration
> It will not merge into an existing NixOS configuration. You can use this code at your on your own risk.

> Currently, this project is on the unstable nixpkgs channel. When 25.11 becomes the new stable branch, the plan it to stay there, then move to the next stable

- Being on the unstable channel is a bigger challenge to support. An update can't prevent a rebuild, or require updating nix settings.

- Make sure to read Hyprland's [WIKI](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nix/Hyprland-on-NixOS/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take note of the requirements
> 
<details>
<summary><strong>👋 👋 👋 Requirements </strong></summary>

- You must be running on NixOS 24.11+
- 25.05+ recommended
- BARE minimum space required is 64GB. 128GB+ is recommended as NixOS is a space-hungry distro
- Must have installed NIXOS using **GPT partition ** & Boot **UEFI**
- `/boot` must be at least 1GB. (Some are now recommending 2GB b/c of firmware size increases)
- Systemd-boot is configured as the default bootloader

> [!TIP]
> if you use GRUB as bootloader you need to edit `hosts/default/config.nix` before install and `flake.nix` for additional grub themes

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong> 🖥️ Multi Host & User Configuration </strong></summary>

- You can now define separate settings for different host machines and users!
- Easily specify extra packages for your users in the users.nix file.
- Easy to understand file structure and simple, but encompassing, configuration.

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong> 📦 How To Install Packages? </strong></summary>

- You can search the [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?)
- [Options](https://search.nixos.org/options?) pages for what a package may be named or if it has options available that take care of configuration hurdles you may face.
- By default, all the packages are in `$HOME/NixOS-Hyprland`
- Then edit `hosts/<your-hostname>/configs.nix` , `hosts/<your-hostname>/packages-fonts.nix` and/or `hosts/<your-hostname>/user.nix` depending on what you want.
- The `config.nix` file is for system packages with options. ie `programs.hyprland.enable=true`
- `$HOME/NixOS-Hyprland/modules/packages.nix` are where you add programs for all hosts globally.
- The packages-fonts.nix file is for adding packagesa or fonts, for that specific host. Changes made to `user.nix` are only available to the current user.
- Once you are finished editing, run:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/NixOS-Hyprland/#<hostName>
```

## ⬇️ Installation

#### 📽 Youtube video for using this script

- [KooL's Hyprland Dots on NixOS](https://youtu.be/nJLnRgnLPWI)

<details>
<summary>📜 1. Using auto install Script: <</summary>
<br>
<div id="autoinstall">
    
- This is the easiest and recommended way of starting out. 
- This script is NOT meant to allow you to change every option that you can in the flake.
- It won't help you install extra packages.
- It is simply here so you can get my configuration installed with as little chance of breakages.
- It is up to you to fiddle with to your heart's content!
- Simply copy this and run it:
```
nix-shell -p git vim curl pciutils
sh <(curl -L https://github.com/JaKooLit/NixOS-Hyprland/raw/main/auto-install.sh)
```
> [!NOTE]
> pciutils is necessary to detect if you have an Nvidia card. 
</div?
</details>

<details>
<summary>🦽 2. Manual: </summary>
<br>
<div id="manualinstall">

- Run this command to ensure git, curl, vim & pciutils are installed: Note: or nano if you prefer nano for editing

```
nix-shell -p git vim curl pciutils
```

- Clone this repo & CD into it:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/NixOS-Hyprland.git ~/NixOS-Hyprland
cd ~/NixOS-Hyprland
```

- _You should stay in this directory for the rest of the install_
- Create the host directory for your machine(s)

```
cp -r hosts/default hosts/<your-desired-hostname>
```

- Edit as required the `config.nix` , `packages-fonts.nix` and/or `users.nix` in `hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/`
- then generate your hardware.nix with:

```
sudo nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config > hosts/<your-desired-hostname>/hardware.nix
```

- Run this to enable flakes and install the flake replacing hostname with whatever you put as the hostname:

```
NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname
```

Once done, you can install the GTK Themes and Hyprland-Dots. Links are above

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>👉🏻 3. Alternative </summary>
    
- auto install by running `./install.sh` after cloning and CD into NixOS-Hyprland
> [!NOTE]
> install.sh is a stripped version of auto-install.sh as it will not re-download repo

- Run this command to ensure git, curl, vim & pciutils are installed: Note: or nano if you prefer nano for editing

```
nix-shell -p git curl pciutils
```

- Clone this repo into your home directory & CD into it:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/NixOS-Hyprland.git ~/NixOS-Hyprland
cd ~/NixOS-Hyprland
```

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> need to download in your home directory as some part of the installer are going back again to ~/NixOS-Hyprland

- _You should stay in this directory for the rest of the install_
- edit `hosts/default/config.nix` to your liking. Once you are satisfied, ran `./install.sh`
  Now when you want to rebuild the configuration, you have access to an alias called `flake-rebuild` that will rebuild the flake!

</details>

Hope you enjoy! 🎉

<details>
<summary><strong>💔 known issues 💔 </strong></summary>
- GTK themes, icons, and the cursor, are not applied automatically. gsettings does not seem to work.
- You can set GTK themes, icons, and the cursor, using nwg-look

<details>
<summary><strong>⌚ Setting timezone </strong></summary>
<br>    
    
- By default, your timezone is configured automatically using the internet. 
- To set your timezone manually, edit `host/<your-hostname>/config.nix`

<details>
<summary><strong>🔙 Reverting back to your default configs </strong></summary>
<br>
<div id="revertconfigs">
    
- If you use flakes, you can just simply locate your default or previous configs. CD into it and execute `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<your-previous-flake-hostname>`
- If you didn't have flakes enabled previously, simply running `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` will revert you to your default configs contained in `/etc/nixos/` 
- ⚠️ just remember to clean up your nix/store to remove unnessary garbage from your system `sudo nix-collect-garbage -d`
- OR, simply just revert into a previous generation of your system by choosing which generation to boot via your bootloader.
