# Changelog ðŸ““

A technical record of notable changes. Dates are in UTC.

## 19 October 2025

- Changed from `nixos-rebuild switch` to `nixos-rebuild boot`
- Modified both `auto-install.sh` and `install.sh`
- This is a best practice especially if currently running a Login Display Mgr
- The switch will reload services and common result is black screen

## 19 September 2025

- Added
    - AGS re-added; quickshell updates were failing on some non-NixOS environments
      after recent upstream changes.
    - pyprland re-added by user request. It is present but not enabled by default.

- Changed
    - Consolidated common packages under modules/packages.nix; extracted fonts to
      modules/fonts.nix.
    - Removed duplicated packages and a stray programs-level xwayland flag
      (Hyprlandâ€™s own xwayland setting remains).
    - Installers refactored to use a shared library scripts/lib/install-common.sh
      with:
        - GPU profile detection (amd | intel | nvidia | nvidia-laptop | vm) with
          user confirmation.
        - pciutils check before use; robust host update in flake.nix.
        - Timezone prompt defaults to auto-detect
          (services.automatic-timezoned.enable = true) unless a manual TZ is set.
        - Console keymap prompt; keyboard layout still written to
          hosts/<host>/variables.nix.
        - fupdate/frebuild scripts fixed to target the active host via nh os switch
          -H ${host} .
    - Zsh defaults: enable programs.zsh at the system level; enable oh-my-zsh for
      the primary user; ensure ~/.zshrc sources /etc/zshrc.

- Fixed
    - Dark mode defaults are applied via system dconf (prefer-dark, Adwaita-dark,
      Papirus-Dark, Bibata cursor) with correct activation ordering.
    - Removed global GTK_THEME and QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE so nwg-look and apps can
      preview/apply themes dynamically; retained QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk3 and
      cursor variables.
    - Installers now toggle drivers/vm settings on the selected host rather than
      the default.
